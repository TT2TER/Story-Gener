Tommy was very close to his dad and loved him greatly. He was a very good kid. I think he was the best kid I ever had.

"He was always a good boy. We were always together. It was just a great family. My dad was my best friend. His dad always was there for me. When I was younger, he would always be there. That's how I remember him. And I'm sure he loved me."

When he turned four, he moved back to Brooklyn and became a lawyer. In his early twenties, Butterfield was elected the state's first black mayor. Butterfields was also the youngest

Tom wanted to gain more muscle. He wanted more power.

"I wanted a bigger body," he said. "I didn't want to be a guy who was going to do a lot of things. I wanted the same thing. And I didn. But I was a little bit nervous.

Tim was dating a girl who was easily scared. "I'm not going to be bullied by people like that," she says. She's also been in therapy, having to put the last few years out of her life because her boyfriend had just shot himself in front of one of his co-workers.

It's not just kids who aren't bullied; even some people who are. When the first episode of The Sopranos was filmed in 1993, only one child was ever bullied, so the show's cast
Samuel collected butterflies for his collection. But he also used a lot of his money to buy butterflies.

He had no idea that his father had butterflies in his head or that he would be collecting them. He knew the butterfly was in the bag so he did not have the need to open it up and collect it. After taking a look at the butterflies, he knew where to find the other butterflies and he was quite happy to be home with them in their bag. When he started collecting butterflies he found the rest
